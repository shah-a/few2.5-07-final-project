# Pokemon Type Matchup

**FEW 2.5: Final Project**

## Description

This is a [D3.js](https://d3js.org/) application that allows users to select a Pokemon and see a visualization of which move-types are super effective against it and which moves are not very effective.

The application is a React.js app, developed using [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) frontend tooling.

## Usage

Navigate to the [live URL](https://shah-a.github.io/few2.5-07-final-project/). Use the dropdown menu to select a pokemon from the list. The graph will update automatically to display the selected pokemon's type matchup statistics.

## Future to-do

Some features that can be added to improve the app:

- Search by Pokemon name/number (search box should have auto-complete)
- Display selected pokemon's type(s) beneath its image
- Make svg display component responsive (rather than fixed width/height)
- Add a button for dark mode colour theme

# INT 2.2: Pokemon Type Matchup

## Description

This is a [D3.js](https://d3js.org/) application that allows users to select a Pokemon and see a visualization of which move-types are super effective against it and which moves are not very effective.

The application is a React.js app, developed using [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) frontend tooling.

## Usage

Navigate to the [live URL](https://shah-a.github.io/int2.2-pokemon-type-matchup/). Use the dropdown menu to select a pokemon from the list. The graph will update automatically to display the selected pokemon's type matchup statistics.

## Future to-do

Some features that can be added to improve the app:

- Display selected pokemon's type(s) beneath its image
- Search by name/number (search box should have auto-complete)
